# Logo Loading Fix - Cross-Environment Compatibility

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The logo loading functionality was working in local development but failing in staging environments and other developer machines. This was due to inconsistent API origin detection and insufficient fallback mechanisms.

## 🔧 Root Causes Identified

1. **Inconsistent API Origin Detection**: The code was not properly detecting staging environments vs local development
2. **Limited URL Candidates**: Not enough fallback paths for different backend configurations
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Limited debugging information when logos failed to load
4. **Environment-Specific Issues**: Different environments had different file serving configurations

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced API Origin Detection

**Files Modified:**
- `src/contexts/BrandingContext.js`
- `src/components/CompaniesTab.jsx`
- `src/utils/environmentUtils.js` (new file)

**Changes:**
- Added robust environment detection for staging vs local development
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for different port configurations
- Enhanced logging for debugging environment-specific issues

```javascript
// Before
const apiOrigin = apiBase.replace(/\/?api\/?$/, '');

// After
const getEffectiveApiOrigin = () => {
  const isStaging = window.location.hostname !== 'localhost' && window.location.hostname !== '127.0.0.1';
  if (isStaging) {
    const protocol = window.location.protocol;
    const hostname = window.location.hostname;
    const port = window.location.port;
    return `${protocol}//${hostname}${port ? ':' + port : ''}`;
  }
  
  const currentOrigin = window.location.origin;
  return currentOrigin !== apiOrigin ? currentOrigin : apiOrigin;
};
```

### 2. Expanded Logo URL Candidates

**Enhanced `buildCompanyLogoCandidates` function:**
- Added multiple URL path variations for different backend configurations
- Included static file serving paths
- Added company-specific logo endpoints
- Improved cache-busting with version parameters

```javascript
// Now tries these paths (in order):
// 1. /api/public/uploads/company-logos/{id}/{filename}
// 2. /uploads/company-logos/{id}/{filename}
// 3. /api/public/files/company-logos/{id}/{filename}
// 4. /files/company-logos/{id}/{filename}
// 5. /api/companies/{id}/logos/{filename}
// 6. /companies/{id}/logos/{filename}
// 7. /static/uploads/company-logos/{id}/{filename}
// 8. /static/files/company-logos/{id}/{filename}
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling & Debugging

**Enhanced LogoCell component:**
- Added loading state indicators
- Improved error messages with visual feedback
- Enhanced console logging for debugging
- Added retry mechanism with candidate fallbacks

```javascript
const handleError = (e) => {
  console.log('Logo load error for company:', company?.name, 'candidate:', candidates[idx]);
  if (idx < candidates.length - 1) {
    setIdx(idx + 1); // Try next candidate
  } else {
    setHasError(true); // Show fallback
  }
};
```

### 4. Created Environment Utilities

**New file: `src/utils/environmentUtils.js`**
- Centralized environment detection logic
- Reusable functions for API origin detection
- Comprehensive debugging utilities
- Consistent behavior across components

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test File Created: `test-logo-loading.html`

This comprehensive test file helps you:
1. **Environment Detection**: Verify correct API origin detection
2. **URL Generation**: Test all logo URL candidates
3. **Cross-Environment Testing**: Test on local, staging, and production
4. **Debug Information**: Export detailed logs for troubleshooting

### How to Use the Test File:

1. **Open the test file** in your browser: `test-logo-loading.html`
2. **Run tests** by clicking "Run All Tests"
3. **Check results** for each company and logo type
4. **Export debug info** if needed for further analysis

### Expected Results:

- ✅ **Local Development**: Should work with all candidates
- ✅ **Staging Environment**: Should detect correct origin and try multiple paths
- ✅ **Production**: Should use production URLs and fallbacks
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Should show meaningful error messages

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Test logo loading in local development
- [ ] Verify API origin detection works correctly
- [ ] Check console logs for any errors
- [ ] Test with different company configurations

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Test logo loading in staging environment
- [ ] Verify staging URLs are being used
- [ ] Check that fallback mechanisms work
- [ ] Monitor console logs for any issues

### For Other Developers:
- [ ] Pull the latest code changes
- [ ] Clear browser cache (important for logo updates)
- [ ] Test logo loading functionality
- [ ] Report any environment-specific issues

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### If Logos Still Don't Load:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for "LogoCell Debug" and "buildCompanyLogoCandidates Debug" messages
2. **Verify API Origin**: Ensure the detected API origin is correct for your environment
3. **Test URL Candidates**: Use the test file to verify which URLs work
4. **Check Backend Configuration**: Ensure your backend serves files from the expected paths

### Common Issues & Solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Logos work locally but not in staging | Check API origin detection - staging should use current origin |
| Some logos load but others don't | Check file paths and permissions on backend |
| All candidates fail | Verify backend file serving configuration |
| Console shows wrong API origin | Clear browser cache and refresh |

### Debug Information to Collect:

```javascript
// Add this to your console to get debug info:
console.log('Environment Debug:', {
  hostname: window.location.hostname,
  origin: window.location.origin,
  apiOrigin: /* your detected API origin */,
  candidates: /* your logo candidates */
});
```

## 📁 Files Modified

## 🎉 Expected Outcomes

After implementing these fixes:

- ✅ **Local Development**: Logos load correctly with proper API origin detection
- ✅ **Staging Environment**: Logos load using staging URLs with multiple fallback paths
- ✅ **Production**: Logos load reliably with production-optimized paths
- ✅ **Cross-Developer**: All team members can see logos regardless of their local setup
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when logos fail to load with debugging information

## 🔄 Future Improvements
